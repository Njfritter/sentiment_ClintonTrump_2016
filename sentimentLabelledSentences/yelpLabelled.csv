"768","I'm so happy to be here!!!;1
Tasted like dirt.;0
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .;1
The block was amazing.;1
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.;1
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!;1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.;0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.;1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its real traditional Hunan style.;0
What did bother me, was the slow service.;0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!;1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.;0
These were so good we ordered them twice.;1
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.;0
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.;0
Unfortunately, it was not good.;0
I had a pretty satifying experience.;1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.;1
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.;1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.;0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.;0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!;1
We will not be coming back.;0
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.;1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.;1
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.;1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.;1
Once your food arrives it's meh.;0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.;0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.;1
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.;0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.;1
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.;1
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;1
Mediocre food.;0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.;1
I'm super pissd.;0
And service was super friendly.;1
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?;0
This place was such a nice surprise!;1
They were golden-crispy and delicious.;1
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.;0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.;1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.;0
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.;1
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.;1
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!;0
The service was terrible though.;0
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!;0
It was packed!!;0
I love this place.;1
I can say that the desserts were yummy.;1
The food was terrible.;0
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.;1
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.;0
This place should honestly be blown up.;0
But I definitely would not eat here again.;0
Do not waste your money here!;0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.;1
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.;1
Awful service.;0
Won't ever go here again.;0
Food quality has been horrible.;0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.;0
The service here is fair at best.;0
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.;0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.;0
Very poor service.;0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.;0
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.;1
They were excellent.;1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.;0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.;1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.;0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.;0
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!;1
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.;0
The food came out at a good pace.;1
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.;1
I won't be back.;0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!;0
This place deserves no stars.;0
I would not recommend this place.;0
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.;1
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.;0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!;0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.;1
I probably would not go here again.;0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.;1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.;1
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.;0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.;0
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.;1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!;1
I probably won't be coming back here.;0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.;0
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.;1
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.;1
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.;0
I love their fries and their beans.;1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.;1
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.;1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.;1
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.;1
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.;1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.;0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.;0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.;0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.;1
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.;1
Weird vibe from owners.;0
There was hardly any meat.;0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.;0
Go To Place for Gyros.;1
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!;1
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.;0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.;0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.;0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.;1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.;0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.;0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.;0
The service was extremely slow.;0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.;0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.;1
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.;0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.;1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.;1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.;0
Worst Thai ever.;0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.;1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.;1
The pizza selections are good.;1
I had strawberry tea, which was good.;1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!;0
Overall, a great experience.;1
Spend your money elsewhere.;0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!;1
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.;0
And the drinks are WEAK, people!;0
-My order was not correct.;0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.;0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.;0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;1
We won't be returning.;0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.;1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.;0
Very, very sad.;0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?;0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!;0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.;0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.;0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better;0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.;0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!;0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.;0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.;0
This place is disgusting!;0
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.;1
The RI style calamari was a joke.;0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.;0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.;0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.;0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.;0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!;0
Disappointing experience.;0
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.;0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.;0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.;0
We won't be going back.;0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.;0
This place lacked style!!;0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.;0
Don't bother coming here.;0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.;0
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.;0
It was equally awful.;0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.;0
very slow at seating even with reservation.;0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.;0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.;0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.;0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.;0
I was VERY disappointed!!;0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.;0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.;0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.;0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.;0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.;0
Con: spotty service.;0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.;0
But then they came back cold.;0
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.;0
The real disappointment was our waiter.;0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.;0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.;0
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.;0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?;0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.;0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!;0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.;0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.;0
But I don't like it.;0
Hell no will I go back;0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.;0
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ya'all.;0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.;0
The ambiance isn't much better.;0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.;0
The food wasn't good.;0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.;0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.;0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.;0
Overpriced for what you are getting.;0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.;0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.;0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.;0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.;0
Food was below average.;0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.;0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.;0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).;0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.;0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.;0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.;0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.;0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.;0
Spend your money and time some place else.;0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.;0
the presentation of the food was awful.;0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.;0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.;0
Appetite instantly gone.;0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.;0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.;0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.;0
